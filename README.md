# Predicting-of-Diabetes-and-Prediabetes-Given-Various-Health-and-Lifestyle-Factors
The project aims to address the challenge of predicting the risk of diabetes and prediabetes among individuals based on various health indicators and lifestyle factors. The primary question revolves around developing machine learning models capable of accurately identifying individuals at risk of developing diabetes or prediabetes based on their demographic information, health metrics, and lifestyle habits. And lastly, healthcare providers can implement targeted interventions and preventive measures to reduce the incidence of diabetes and its associated complications. Our project aims to address a few key questions:

* Which behaviors are most closely linked with a diabetes or prediabetes diagnosis?
* Can we accurately predict diabetes within an individual, knowing certain characteristics?
* Is the BRFSS, as currently constructed, the best remote diagnosis tool at our disposal?
* Could we remove questions from the BRFSS or add entirely new ones to create an even better or just as good model for prediction?

The dataset has been evaluated and determined that it provides sufficient information to answer the primary research questions related to predicting the risk of prediabetes or diabetes. It has been ensured that key variables, such as those related to health indicators and lifestyle factors, are present and informative. The source of our data is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a U.S. government agency so we can be fairly certain that it is trustworthy. Upon inspection of the data, no missing values were found, which further confirms that this dataset should be well-suited to our needs. Finally, owing to the large size of the dataset which contains over a quarter million rows, even if we were to discover that the dataset contains bias or skew it is still possible to take a sizable subset that would be balanced and or normal and would still satisfy our requirements and give us what we need to address our questions.

Our project will focus on one year’s worth of data collected from this survey (2015, to be specific). This data set contains 253,680 survey responses and can be found on Kaggle.com at the URL https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset .  The target variable we are most interested in is Diabete_012 which contains 3 classes: 0,1 and 2 corresponding to non-diabetic, prediabetic, and diabetic, respectively.
To give a general idea of features contained in the data set, it includes information related to BMI (Body Mass Index), cholesterol and blood pressure levels and a history of heart attacks. It also has features for survey responses about diet, exercise, and self-evaluation of one’s physical and mental health. Finally, the data set contains demographics such as age, sex, education, and income.
Our group aims to produce a predictive model with the power to forecast whether one is at risk of being prediabetic or having diabetes based on a variety of factors. Being able to accurately diagnose this disease, diabetes, or a predisposition to it, prediabetes, with a non-trivial level of certainty without actually needing physical access to a patient could theoretically save lives and associated healthcare costs!
